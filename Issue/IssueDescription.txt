When we insert multiple 2D dwg models into the viewer, their scale is incorrect.  The geometry seems to size to fill the 
approximate area that the previous model occupied. It is very unsual. 

Screenshots:
drawing1.png - 1x.dwg in the viewer.  (1.0 x 1.0 square)
drawing2.png - 10x.dwg in the viewer (10.0 x 10.0 square)
overlapped.png - Both drawings loaded in the viewer, they occupy the same space. ????
